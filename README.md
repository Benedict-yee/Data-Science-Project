# Data-Science-Project
This repository contains projects & portfolios of data science work completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. All work is presented in the form of IPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (data files are located in each project folders) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Micro Projects: 
	- [Credit_card_fraud](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict Credit Card Fraud cases. The data is extremly imbalanced. I am proposing several pre-processing steps and candidates of the best ML models. You can find deployed my web app [here](https://yeeproject.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Dry_beans](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to classify 7 different beans. I am proposing several pre-processing steps and candidates of the best ML models.
